# CDCKTest

## Usage
Follow this [official Apple developer article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/mirroring_a_core_data_store_with_cloudkit/setting_up_core_data_with_cloudkit) beginning from the 'Enable iCloud' section up until the 'Enable CloudKit and Push Notifications' section (inclusive) to appropriately configure and test this project.

**NOTE**: As far as I am aware, you are required to have a working iCloud account to use CloudKit.

## Demo
